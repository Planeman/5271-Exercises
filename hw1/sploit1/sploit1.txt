Sploit1 Description
===================
Sploit1 takes advantage of a buffer overflow in the checkin conditional
of the copyFile function. This sploit is a standard buffer overflow
leading to a control flow hijack. The overwritten return pointer of the
copyFile function points back down the stack into the approximate region
where the src and dest buffers are which hits a nop sled.


Design Changes to Prevent Sploit 
=================================
This sploit could most simply be changed by a proper use of the strncpy
and strncat functions to avoid the buffer overflow.

Then the question becomes what to do when some input becomes struncated,
do you explcitly check if the input string is too long for the
destination buffer and return an error or do you take whatever was
copied?
